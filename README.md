# Amazon Sales Prediction Project

Predicting Amazon Sales with Data Science ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for my Amazon sales prediction project. The goal of this project is to use data science and machine learning techniques to predict Amazon sales, enabling sellers to make informed decisions and optimize their strategies.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Collection**: I gathered Amazon sales data from various sources to create a comprehensive dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned, transformed, and prepared the data for analysis and modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored the dataset to gain insights and identify patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created relevant features to improve model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Developed predictive models using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Used appropriate evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
- **Visualization**: Presented results and insights using visualizations and charts.
